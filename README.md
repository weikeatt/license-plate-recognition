# üöó License Plate Detection & Recognition
This project uses **OpenCV** for license plate detection and **EasyOCR** for optical character recognition (OCR) to extract and identify license plate text from images and videos. It supports multiple languages and includes a simple database verification system to enable automated gate access or alerting.

## üî• Features
- Detects license plates in images and video frames  
- Uses contour detection and Haar Cascade classifier for plate localization  
- Applies EasyOCR for accurate multi-language text recognition  
- Supports English and Simplified Chinese (customizable)  
- Crops and highlights license plate regions  
- Compares recognized plates against a stored database file (`database.txt`)  
- Prints welcome messages and simulates gate opening on recognized plates  
- Real-time video processing with OpenCV
